### 3.The case when quote server (forismatic) is unvailable.

As this is just a demo project. To reduce the dependencies of this project, I stored the cached quote data directly in program memory. In a production environment, we can store the data in better storage solutions like Redis, MongoDB, or even MySQL to enhance availability.

This program will cache 100 quotes which were got from forismatic. When forismatic service is unvailable, it will get quote from cache.
To test this case, you can do follow this way:

(1) start web server if it is not running
```
go run main.go 
```

(2) visit the webpage http://127.0.0.1:8080 and click the button "Change Quote" several times to get and cache quotes.

(3) modify the conf/app.yaml fileï¼Œchange the value of quoteServerUrl from 'http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/' to other value, such as 'http://api123.forismatic.com/api/1.0/'

(4) continue to click the button "Change Quote" on the webpage, you will see it still works,but you can look at the terminal. There will be some error logs show that "get quote from forismatic error"
